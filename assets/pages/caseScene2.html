                    <h2>A female employee faces gender-based discrimination at her workplace, leading to an investigation and corrective measures under the Labor Code and relevant gender equality laws</h2>

                            Sofia, a skilled IT specialist, has been working at a tech company for five years. She consistently meets or exceeds performance expectations, yet she notices that male colleagues in similar roles are receiving higher salaries, better project opportunities, and promotions that she has been passed over for, despite her qualifications and experience. Feeling unfairly treated, Sofia decides to bring her concerns to the attention of the human resources department. <br><br>
    
                            The company investigates Sofiaâ€™s claims and reviews salary records, promotion criteria, and the treatment of employees in similar positions. During the investigation, it is confirmed that Sofia has been subjected to gender-based discrimination, which violates provisions in the Labor Code and laws promoting gender equality, such as RA 7192 (Women in Nation Building Law). <br><br>
    
                            Sofia is offered compensation for the wage gap and additional support to ensure she receives equal opportunities moving forward. The company also commits to implementing new training programs on gender equality and revising its policies to prevent discrimination.
    
                            <br><br>
                            Laws promoting gender equality, including the Labor Code and RA 7192, require employers to provide equal treatment and opportunities regardless of gender. These laws protect employees like Sofia by ensuring that discriminatory practices are addressed and corrected.
    
                            <br><br>
                            The company takes corrective measures by offering Sofia fair compensation and setting up a plan to promote equal treatment. Training for all staff is introduced to raise awareness about gender equality and eliminate unconscious biases. This helps create a more inclusive work culture, empowering all employees to perform without discrimination.
